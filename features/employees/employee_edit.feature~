Feature: Edit Allocation
  As a registered user of the website
  I want to edit the allocation name
  so I can change the allocation name

    Scenario: I sign in and edit the allocation
      Given I am logged in
        And I registered assets
        And I registered allocation
      When I look at the list of allocation
      Then I should see the allocation lists
      When I edit the allocation name
      Then I should see edit allocation name
